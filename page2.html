			I got my liscense when I was 16 years old and my dad let me drive his '05 Toyota Tundra to school, as he had just gotten a new car. I had been driving it for about a month when one day on my way to school, I rolled my truck upside down flat across the road. I was fine, even though my airbag didn't go off. I was hanging upside down and rolled my window "down" (but it went up), unbuckled my seatbelt and crawled out. The lady who was driving behind me called 911 which I thought was a good idea, I was halfway through dialing my parents phone number. I called them and they came, and so did the police and a ton of other people because I was blocking the whole road. We got the truck towed and my mom gave me a ride to school. I made it to school on time that day and all everyone kept asking me was "Why are you here?" as word of what had happened that morning got around. I guess I probably shouldn't have gone to school that day, but I was fine except for a couple of scrapes on my knuckles and my back and shoulders were a little sore the next day. After that I went back to riding the bus and didn't drive a car for about a month or so which was probably a good thing.
