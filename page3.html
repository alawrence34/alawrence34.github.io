			I am eternally greatful that after I flipped my dad's old truck, which he had been letting me drive his truck to school, he ever let me drive a vehicle again much less buy me a new one. That being said, about a month or so after said accident we went to Garrett's Auto Sales in Holden. My mom was determined that I get something with at least AWD if not 4 wheel with the amount of snow and ice we get here. They were thinking a Subaru Outback or Forester, but Garrett convinced them to go with my current car, a red Subaru Impreza. Say what you will about its little 4 cylinder, especially with the snow tires on it, is a tank in the snow. Everyone tells me I still don't know how to drive in the winter because I've been driving this car since 2016. My door did get backed into and my mom and dad to this day disagree whose fault it was, but I couldn't really say anything since they bought me the car. Eventually we bondoed it up and repainted it so it looks a little better now than it does in that picture, but it does make me feel better about half my exhaust falling off.
