			I am a left handed 18 year old from Orrington Maine. I am a commuter student which makes the snow tires on my Subaru Impreza necessary. My drivers side door is a little bit dented in, but thats nothing compared to the condition of the last vehicle I was driving. For this website I've decided to go through the cars I've drove, the condition they're in, as well as the other cars that I have driven in the last few years of high school.
